# How to update the list:

## Before you update your list
    Before you update your list you need to do some things to make sure things goes smoothly.
    You will need to backup some files from overwrite. The files you need to backup are:
    stealthrunner/sessions
    
    Stocks/data/persistent

    And you back them up like this in the image:
![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/4777ff5a-2701-4ca1-b467-aba4b858d967)

    Then you should clear out overwrite 

![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/a222e637-437e-4553-b28c-d71fe3168342)

## After that you will need to go do [Step 1](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/4777ff5a-2701-4ca1-b467-aba4b858d967) in the main readme.

    Very important to do this step to make sure your game folder is clean.

## Updating your list

    To update your list you just need to start Wabbajack like normal and install the list with overwrite checked
    and the install paths pointing to the right folder same with the download folder.
![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/08397dfc-23be-4725-af9d-167c0050d5d2)

## After you updated the list you might need to re-order your tattoos or overlays again. Check below for instructions.

## Make sure Lizzies Braindance and Romance messages Extended are working.

    Also make sure you always after every update go back to H10 and you should get a popup about Lizzies Braindances 
    when you enter the apartment and you need to turn on the TV and you should get a message about 
    Judy Romance Messages Extended and Panam Romance Messages Extended. 
    If that dont happen leave the apartment and enter again.

# How to use Tattoos and Body overlays

    The list currently supports VTK overlays but you can only have ONE active at the time
    and to change it you will need to do the following steps.

## 1. First find the tattoo you like and check it in MO2

![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/9019a472-52e4-406b-9185-51a906a20f3f)

## 2. Open Red4-conflicts

![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/44fdde96-cd1e-4a5e-ad91-944aaa8a3d95)

## 3. After Red4-conflicts open
        You will need to go to the bottome of the left panel and find your overlays
        and drag them up to the top like in the second image. Currently you can only move the files one at the time.
        If the overlay mod comes with a head option you need to move the head file over Avamicrodetails.archive.
        After you moved all files you can close Red4-conflicts and start the game up and the overlay should work.

# Reseting mods

## How to reset Lizzies Braindance.

        Sometimes after an update you will need to reset Lizzie's Braindance

        Reseting mod

        Game.GetQuestsSystem():SetFactStr("lizzies_bds_reset", 1)

        Then save the game and load the newly created savegame. NPC should be available again.

        If you don't have any options with the NPC, use this command:

        Game.GetQuestsSystem():SetFactStr("lizzies_bds_active", 0)

<br>

    Then Save and reload that save. After that go in to photomode again and enabled the replacer 
    and you will see nibbles looking like a human.

    After that you can close CET and pose the models with making sure the cordinates in photo mode 
    match up between V and Replacer. Some poses only work for certain body types in most cases it 
    will tell you what the pose is for Female, Male or Big Male
