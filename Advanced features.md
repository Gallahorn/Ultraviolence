# How to update the list:

## Before you update your list
    Before you update your list you need to do some things to make sure things goes smoothly.
    You will need to backup some files from overwrite. The files you need to backup are:
    stealthrunner/sessions
    
    Stocks/data/persistent

    And you back them up like this in the image:

## After that you will need to go do [Step 1](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/4777ff5a-2701-4ca1-b467-aba4b858d967) in the main readme.

    Very important to do this step to make sure your game folder is clean.

## Updating your list

    To update your list you just need to start Wabbajack like normal and install the list with overwrite checked
    and the install paths pointing to the right folder same with the download folder.

# How to use Tattoos and Body overlays

    The list currently supports VTK overlays but you can only have ONE active at the time
    and to change it you will need to do the following steps.

## 1. First find the tattoo you like and check it in MO2

## 3. After Red4-conflicts open
        You will need to go to the bottome of the left panel and find your overlays
        and drag them up to the top like in the second image. Currently you can only move the files one at the time.
        If the overlay mod comes with a head option you need to move the head file over Avamicrodetails.archive.
        After you moved all files you can close Red4-conflicts and start the game up and the overlay should work.
