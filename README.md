  - Go to [keybinds section](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/blob/main/Advanced%20features.md#keybinds) and look up what you need to bind in CET.

# 11. Before you start playing

  - Make sure you have Texture Quality set to High in the settings and you can only change this in the main menu before loading a game.
    If you dont you will have weird textures on arms/body/faces.

  - You need to take a look at [Advanced Features](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/blob/main/Advanced%20features.md)
    before you play. Most important is to look over the keybind section.
