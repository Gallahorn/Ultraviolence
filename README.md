## 16. When you start the game CET will popup and want you to pick a hotkey for its menu.

    CET is a important mod so make the hotkey pretty easy to access I have mine next to the Enter key.

    Then click on Bindings and bind the mod to what you want.
    Important mods for me are the following:

    * CustomQuickslots - What ever slots you want to use. This one you can configure at a later state.
    * AppearanceMenuMod - Open Appearance Menu
    * AutoLoot - The autoloot key
    * Flashlight

    After you setup the keybinds for the mods you want you. Hit save and then you can close the CET menu.



# 18. Now you can start playing.
