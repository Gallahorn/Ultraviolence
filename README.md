## 4.1 Then click on "Browse Modslists" on the first page again.
![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/6c7f4ee9-1add-4c55-923c-45ac86b320c5)

## 4.2 Then select the same options as the image

## 4.4 After the download is finished hit play.


## 4.5 Click on the 3 dots on Modlist Installation Location and choose where you want to install your modlist.

 ### - If you are updating the list make sure you check Overwrite Installation.
 
 ### - Install the list on the same drive as where you have cyberpunk installed.

![image](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/assets/13502434/84adc015-e782-46e0-9f0a-3bf578773abc)



## 4.6 When you have made all the choices it should look something like this.
  
  - It is recommended to create two separate folders, one for downloaded mods, and one for modlist installation
    - Create one folder for the modlist, on the same drive that you installed Cyberpunk (and not in a protected folder mentioned above).
    - Create another folder for the modlist downloads. Because this is just storage, it can be placed anywhere else, even on a slower hard drive if space is a concern. Having a separate download folder means your downloads won't be wiped when you reinstall or update the modlist, and makes updating faster when you don't have to redownload the required mods.
  - Your final folder setup may look something like this:
    -   D:\Cyperpunk2077\    (your base game path, in a non-protected folder)
    -   D:\Ultraviolence\    (actual modlist install, preferably on the same drive as your game)
    -   D:\ultraviolence-downloads\    (your separate downloads location, used for storage)
    
  - If you are doing a update of the list make sure you check the "Overwrite Installation"

# 14. Gameplay changes

  ## 14.1 Wannabe Edgerunner

    The "Wannabe Edgerunner - A simple Cyberpsychosis mod" introduces significant gameplay changes to Cyberpunk 2077 
    by incorporating a cyberpsychosis mechanic that simulates the mental instability caused by overusing cybernetic implants. 
    
    Here’s how it affects gameplay:

    1. Humanity Cost for Cyberware
    Each cyberware installation reduces V's "humanity" stat, representing their psychological stability.
    Different cyberware types have varying humanity costs. Players must balance the power they gain from 
    cyberware with the potential loss of humanity.
    
    2. Cyberpsychosis State
    If V's humanity drops below a certain threshold, they risk entering a state of cyberpsychosis.
    During cyberpsychosis:
    Debuffs: V may suffer penalties like reduced accuracy, increased recoil, health regeneration loss,
    or erratic stamina behavior.
    Behavioral Changes: V may exhibit uncontrollable or reckless actions.

    3. Humanity Regeneration and Recovery
    Humanity can recover over time or through specific in-game actions, such as removing cyberware 
    or using recovery methods introduced by the mod.

    4. Customizability
    The mod includes options to tailor the experience, such as adjusting:  
      The humanity cost of individual cyberware.
      The threshold for triggering cyberpsychosis.
      The intensity and duration of debuffs.
      This allows players to align the mod’s mechanics with their preferred level of challenge.

    5. Enhanced Immersion
    The mod introduces a risk-reward system, emphasizing the consequences of over-augmentation.
    It encourages more strategic gameplay, making players think twice before installing every 
    available cyberware piece.
    By adding this mechanic, the mod significantly increases the depth and realism of the Cyberpunk 2077 experience, 
    aligning the gameplay with the lore of the cyberpunk genre.

  ## 14.2 Santa Muerte

    The Santa Muerte - Death Alternative mod for Cyberpunk 2077 transforms the gameplay experience by introducing alternative outcomes to V's death, moving away from the standard game over screen. Here's how it changes gameplay:

    1. Dynamic Death Scenarios
    Instead of restarting at the last checkpoint when V dies, the mod initiates alternative scenarios:
    Rescue Events: Friendly NPCs or factions may intervene to save V, adding a narrative twist.
    Revival Scenes: V may wake up in a medical facility, hideout, or other location, reflecting the game's immersive world.
    Capture or Loss: In some cases, V may be captured as a consequence of dying.

    2. Consequences for Failure
    Death is no longer the end but comes with penalties:
    Setbacks in quests or progress, depending on the context of the death.

    3. Immersive Continuity
    The mod blends V's failures into the world of Night City, maintaining immersion by treating death as part of the narrative.
    For example:
    V might wake up in a ripperdoc's clinic after being "saved."
    Gangs or enemies might exploit V's vulnerability.

  ## 14.3 Dark Future

    The Dark Future - Urban Survival Gameplay mod introduces several gameplay changes to Cyberpunk 2077, transforming it into a more immersive survival experience. Here’s how it alters the game:

    1. Basic Needs Management
    Hunger, Thirst, and Energy:
    V now needs to eat, drink, and sleep to stay functional.
    Neglecting these needs results in penalties like:
    Reduced stamina regeneration.
    Lower movement speed.
    Impaired reflexes and aim.
    Players must gather food, beverages, and find opportunities to rest to maintain these stats.

    2. Anxiety and Mental Health
    Stress Accumulation:
    Engaging in combat or stressful events increases V’s anxiety levels.
    High anxiety can lead to:
    Shaky aim.
    Decreased hacking efficiency.
    Slower reaction times.
    Stress Relief:
    Anxiety can be managed by relaxing in safe areas, sleeping, or using specific items such as medications or recreational substances.

    3. Addiction System
    Using stimulants or certain consumables carries a risk of addiction.
    Addiction Effects:
    Negative impacts on performance, such as debuffs to stats or withdrawal symptoms if V doesn’t consume the addictive substance.
    Management:
    Players must carefully balance the use of substances or seek remedies to overcome addiction.

    4. Sleep and Rest Mechanics
    Regular sleep is required to maintain energy and mental stability.
    Lack of sleep results in:
    Reduced stamina.
    Slower reflexes.
    Players are encouraged to use V’s apartment or find other safe locations for rest.

    5. Immersive Role-Playing Elements
    Encourages careful resource management and strategic planning.
    Adds realism by tying V’s physical and mental state directly to gameplay performance.
    Creates a daily cycle where survival is intertwined with mission objectives.

    6. Balancing and Realism
    These mechanics force players to think beyond combat and hacking, incorporating survival elements into every aspect of gameplay.
    The changes make Night City feel more alive and demanding, emphasizing its harsh and unforgiving nature.
    
    Overall Impact: This mod shifts Cyberpunk 2077 from a purely action-oriented RPG to a survival-driven experience, requiring players to carefully manage V’s physical and mental health to thrive in the dystopian setting.
