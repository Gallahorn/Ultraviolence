## 13. Options in MO2

  ### Graphic Mods
    Pick the options for your hardware. Current options are for my mid tier computer.
    You can see what fps i get in the benchmark on the images under with the settings the list comes with.
    My hardware:
    I5-12600k
    Geforce 3070
    32 gb Ram

## A note if you run with RT ON turn off Ray-Traced Sun Shadows and Ray-Traced Local Shadows or turn off RT overdrive mod else you will have bugs with shadows.

    Edge Lut you have to different versions to pick from I prefer the vibrant version but try them out. 
    Can only have one of the Edge Lut on at the same time.


    Then we have Dlssg-to-fsr3 If you have a Nvidia card you can turn on frame generation with this mod 
    but you will have to read the instructions on the mod page on what you need to turn on for it to 
    work and what cards. For me it gives around 20-30 fps extra with some ghosting when you are driving 
    but to me its not that bad.

[dlssg-to-fsr3 (Replace Nvidia DLSS-G Frame Gen with AMD FSR 3 Frame Gen)](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738)

    Right click and Visit on Nexus and look at the images or test ingame.

### Cloth Mods

  - Cyberarms only pick one option of the 3. Some of them causes some cliping issues so you will have to
    experiment whats acceptable for you.
    If you want nails before using cyberarms you need to disable Araska Cyberarms

## 15. When you start the game CET will popup and want you to pick a hotkey for its menu.

   CET is a important mod so make the hotkey pretty easy to access I have mine next to the Enter key.
