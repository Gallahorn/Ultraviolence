# 2 Install instructions
Screenshots below assume the Steam version of the game. For GoG, see [Install with GOG version](Advanced%20features.md#installation-with-gog-version) and then continue with the Wabbajack steps below.

> [!TIP]
> As far as we know, the EPIC store version of Cyberpunk should work as well.  
> Since nobody of the dev team owns the game on EPIC, you're gonig to have to figure out how to install with EPIC by yourself :)

## 2.1 Make a clean cyberpunk installation
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure ***NOT to install*** the base game or modlist ***in a protected folder***!  
> ![image](img/installation/protectedfolders.png)

- Follow [these instructions](https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/sp-technical/issue/2233/how-do-i-perform-a-clean-install-of-the-game) to make sure you have a clean fresh install of Cyberpunk
- Make sure you have **__all DLC installed__**, as puctured below.  
**__YOU NEED Phantom Liberty and REDmod to install this modlist.__**

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have it yet, you can grab [Redmod here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060310/Cyberpunk_2077_REDmod/).

- After you have finished verifying your game, launch it from steam and enable mods in the REDlauncher.

- Once the game has loaded, in the settings under gameplay, ***turn off analytics and crossplatform saves***.

## 2.2 Download Wabbajack

- Select your ***installation folder*** and ***downloads folder*** as you desire (outside of protected folders as mentioned above).

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to select your installation folder to be ***ON THE SAME DRIVE*** as your Cyberpunk installation.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend, to keep your downloads folder ***outside*** of your installation folder.  
> Because this is just storage, it can be placed anywhere else, even on a slower hard drive if space is a concern. Having a separate download folder means your downloads won't be wiped when you reinstall or update the modlist, and makes updating faster when you don't have to redownload the required mods.  
>  
> Your final folder setup may look something like this:  
> -   D:\Cyperpunk2077\    (your base game path, in a non-protected folder)
> -   D:\Ultraviolence\    (actual modlist install, preferably on the same drive as your game)
> -   D:\ultraviolence-downloads\    (your separate downloads location, used for storage)
- Hit install and wait until the "Installation finished" screen appears.
- On this screen, select "Open in File Explorer".
