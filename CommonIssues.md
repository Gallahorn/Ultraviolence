# Installation
This section lists problems that can occur during the installation of the modlist.


## I'm stuck at the main menu screen
... but the main menu isn't showing.

This occurs because you skipped a step in the [Installation](Installation.md) section of the readme.  
You **__NEED__** to start the vanilla game first before starting the modlist in MO2.  

Please refer to the linked section above and make sure you follow **__ALL THE STEPS__**.


## Cannot open instance 'Portable'
If you get an error like this:  
![Image](/img/commonissues/commonissues_specialcharacters.png)

Make sure not to use any special characters in your folder name except for dashes (-).  
Wabbajack can't handle characters like [ ] in folder names.


## FileNotFoundError [WinError3] 
If you get an error like this:  
![Image](img/commonissues/commonissues_winerror3.png)

Your Wabbajack install didn't finish correctly (even if it reported no problems).  
Run Wabbajack again and point it to the same folders you did last time.


# Gameplay
This section lists problem that can occur during the gameplay in Ultraviolence.


## My difficulty seems to be incorrect
The modlist is engineered for VERY HARD difficulty only.  
So you must remain at VERY HARD at all times.

> [!WARNING]
> If you lower your difficulty, your game might become even harder, because the mods are not tuned to those difficulties.
