# 3 Post installation instructions
After you finished your installation, it's time to customize the list for your pc.

## 3.1 Start Mod Organizer
- Open the program by starting ModOrganizer.exe
- On first run, you may see the following message when MO2 is copying your settings for the first time.  
This is normal and the message can be disregarded.

## 3.2 Options in MO2
- Pick the options for your hardware. Current options are for my mid tier computer.  
If you are interested in what performance to expect, you can see my benchmarks [here](Performance.md).

### 3.2.1 Nova Rain and Dirt Begone
- Select Nova Rain and Dirt Begone for your system.  
Only one of the two options for each mod should be enabled at any given time.

### 3.2.2 Controller or KBM
- Select one option here depending if you use a controller or not.  
**__I don't give any support for controllers so you will need to look up how to use the mod.__**
