# 4 First game start

## 4.1 Run the game
- Run the launcher and make sure mods are enabled and also ***don't ever touch the unlock button***!

## 4.2 CET Keybinds
- When you start the game CET will popup and want you to pick a hotkey for its menu.  
CET is an important mod, so make the hotkey pretty easy to access. I have mine set next to the Enter key.

- When you arrive at the "Press space to continue" screen hit the CET to open the menu.  
Go to [keybinds section](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/blob/main/Advanced%20features.md#keybinds) and look up what you need to bind in CET.

# 5 Ingame settings
- Make sure you have Texture Quality set to High in the settings.  
> [!WARNING]
> You can only change this in the main menu before loading a game.  
> If you don't set the Textures to High, you will have weird textures on arms/body/faces.

- Make sure you unbind or rebind "Cycle Weapon" under Key Bindings.

- You need to take a look at [Advanced Features](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/blob/main/Advanced%20features.md)
    before you play.  
    Most important is to look over the keybind section.

# 6 Now you can start a new game!

## 6.1 When you are ingame
- Open CET and pick a LUT you like with LUT SWITCHER

- Take a look [here](https://github.com/Gallahorn/Ultraviolence/blob/main/Advanced%20features.md#how-to-unlock-romance-options) how to enable Panam Romance as Female V.

- Visit H10 apartment after new install or update and watch the TV in the apartment.

- Dont EVER equip modded clothes in vanilla slots. Use wardrobe function for everything modded.

# 7 ALL DONE!
You're done.  
Congratulations.  

Have a great adventure in Cyberpunk and enjoy your stay with UltraViolence!

> [!WARNING]
> If you're a new player to the modlist, or you just updated, we **__highly recommend__** that you take a look at our [Advanced Features](AdvancedFeatures.md) and [Gameplay](Gameplay.md) pages, as these pages will show you many of the added features and tell you how the vastly altered gameplay in this modlist works.
