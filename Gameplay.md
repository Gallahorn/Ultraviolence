## 1. Wannabe Edgerunner

The "Wannabe Edgerunner - A simple Cyberpsychosis mod" introduces significant gameplay changes to Cyberpunk 2077 by incorporating a cyberpsychosis mechanic that simulates the mental instability caused by overusing cybernetic implants. 
    
Here’s how it affects gameplay:

1. Humanity Cost for Cyberware
Each cyberware installation reduces V's "humanity" stat, representing their psychological stability.
Different cyberware types have varying humanity costs. Players must balance the power they gain from cyberware with the potential loss of humanity.
    
2. Cyberpsychosis State
If V's humanity drops below a certain threshold, they risk entering a state of cyberpsychosis.  
During cyberpsychosis:  
- Debuffs: V may suffer penalties like reduced accuracy, increased recoil, health regeneration loss, or erratic stamina behavior.  
- Behavioral Changes: V may exhibit uncontrollable or reckless actions.

3. Humanity Regeneration and Recovery
Humanity can recover over time or through specific in-game actions, such as removing cyberware or using recovery methods introduced by the mod.

4. Customizability
The mod includes options to tailor the experience, such as adjusting:  
- The humanity cost of individual cyberware.
- The threshold for triggering cyberpsychosis.
- The intensity and duration of debuffs.
- This allows players to align the mod’s mechanics with their preferred level of challenge.

5. Enhanced Immersion
The mod introduces a risk-reward system, emphasizing the consequences of over-augmentation.  
It encourages more strategic gameplay, making players think twice before installing every available cyberware piece.  
By adding this mechanic, the mod significantly increases the depth and realism of the Cyberpunk 2077 experience, aligning the gameplay with the lore of the cyberpunk genre.

## 2. Santa Muerte

The "Santa Muerte - Death Alternative" mod for Cyberpunk 2077 transforms the gameplay experience by introducing alternative outcomes to V's death, moving away from the standard game over screen.  
Here's how it changes gameplay:

1. Dynamic Death Scenarios
Instead of restarting at the last checkpoint when V dies, the mod initiates alternative scenarios:  
- Rescue Events: Friendly NPCs or factions may intervene to save V, adding a narrative twist.
- Revival Scenes: V may wake up in a medical facility, hideout, or other location, reflecting the game's immersive world.
- Capture or Loss: In some cases, V may be captured as a consequence of dying.

2. Consequences for Failure
Death is no longer the end but comes with penalties:  
Setbacks in quests or progress, depending on the context of the death.

3. Immersive Continuity
The mod blends V's failures into the world of Night City, maintaining immersion by treating death as part of the narrative.  
For example:  
- V might wake up in a ripperdoc's clinic after being "saved."
- Gangs or enemies might exploit V's vulnerability.

## 3. Dark Future

The "Dark Future - Urban Survival Gameplay" mod introduces several gameplay changes to Cyberpunk 2077, transforming it into a more immersive survival experience.  

Here’s how it alters the game:

1. Basic Needs Management  
Hunger, Thirst, and Energy:  
V now needs to eat, drink, and sleep to stay functional.  
Neglecting these needs results in penalties like:  
- Reduced stamina regeneration.
- Lower movement speed.
- Impaired reflexes and aim.
- Players must gather food, beverages, and find opportunities to rest to maintain these stats.

2. Anxiety and Mental Health
Stress Accumulation:  
Engaging in combat or stressful events increases V’s anxiety levels.  
High anxiety can lead to:
- Shaky aim.
- Decreased hacking efficiency.
- Slower reaction times.  
Stress Relief:
- Anxiety can be managed by relaxing in safe areas, sleeping, or using specific items such as medications or recreational substances.

3. Addiction System  
Using stimulants or certain consumables carries a risk of addiction.  
Addiction Effects:
- Negative impacts on performance, such as debuffs to stats or withdrawal symptoms if V doesn’t consume the addictive substance.  
Management:
- Players must carefully balance the use of substances or seek remedies to overcome addiction.

4. Sleep and Rest Mechanics  
Regular sleep is required to maintain energy and mental stability.  
Lack of sleep results in:
- Reduced stamina.
- Slower reflexes.
- Players are encouraged to use V’s apartment or find other safe locations for rest.

5. Immersive Role-Playing Elements  
Encourages careful resource management and strategic planning.  
Adds realism by tying V’s physical and mental state directly to gameplay performance.  
Creates a daily cycle where survival is intertwined with mission objectives.

6. Balancing and Realism
These mechanics force players to think beyond combat and hacking, incorporating survival elements into every aspect of gameplay.  
The changes make Night City feel more alive and demanding, emphasizing its harsh and unforgiving nature.  
    
Overall Impact: This mod shifts Cyberpunk 2077 from a purely action-oriented RPG to a survival-driven experience, requiring players to carefully manage V’s physical and mental health to thrive in the dystopian setting.
