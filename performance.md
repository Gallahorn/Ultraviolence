# Performance
In this file you will find some benchmark numbers of a variety of systems, so you are able to gauge on how good the modlist will run for you.  
Hardware details for each system will be provided in each section.  

As the landscape of current hardware is ever shifting, we will refrain from labelling system as low- or high-end etc.

> [!TIP]
> The presets will say "custom" on these benchmarks because the "Textures" slider has to remain on "high" for certain mods to work properly, even when in lower presets.
